## Introduction
This is a distributed version of GSS(Graph Stream Sketch) written in Java. Since this is only a prototype and only a graduation project, it's a bit simple.
The original purpose was to support the use of DGSS in Janus Graph(a graph database), but due to the time limit, now it's only an algorithm prototype.

The original GSS paper can be found here:[Graph stream sketch: Summarizing graph streams with high speed and accuracy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9774007&casa_token=SUm38FVCpOMAAAAA:6XMCY3ktV57FTSzaG9xq7Jlyv97gi2maAGLHdK5mPAxXiMDvrdYWn0qpOFOrujsZewL2DgQw) [[bibtex](#citation)].
